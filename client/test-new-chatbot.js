console.log(`🤰 **Tight Stomach Feeling During Pregnancy - Complete Guide:**

🔍 **COMMON CAUSES BY TRIMESTER:**

**First Trimester (1-12 weeks):**
• **Gas and bloating** - progesterone slows digestion
• **Uterine stretching** - organ growing from walnut to grapefruit size
• **Constipation** - hormones slow bowel movements
• **Early Braxton Hicks** - rare but possible

**Second Trimester (13-27 weeks):**
• **Round ligament pain** - ligaments stretching to support growing uterus
• **Braxton Hicks contractions** - irregular "practice" contractions
• **Baby movements** - can feel like tightening
• **Growing uterus** - reaching up toward ribs

**Third Trimester (28-40 weeks):**
• **Frequent Braxton Hicks** - preparing for labor
• **Baby's position** - head down can create pressure
• **Uterine muscle fatigue** - carrying increasing weight
• **Pre-labor contractions** - becoming more organized

🆚 **BRAXTON HICKS vs REAL CONTRACTIONS:**

**Braxton Hicks (False Labor):**
• Irregular timing (every 30 mins to 2 hours)
• Don't get stronger over time
• Stop with position change or walking
• Usually painless or mildly uncomfortable
• Felt mainly in front of belly
• Don't get closer together

**Real Labor Contractions:**
• Regular pattern (every 5-10 minutes, then closer)
• Get progressively stronger and longer
• Continue despite position changes
• Increasingly painful
• Pain wraps around back
• Get closer together over time

💡 **IMMEDIATE RELIEF TECHNIQUES:**

**Position Changes:**
• Lie on left side with pillow between knees
• Sit and lean forward slightly
• Get on hands and knees (cat position)
• Walk slowly if contractions stop with movement
• Empty bladder (full bladder can trigger tightening)

**Comfort Measures:**
• Warm (not hot) bath - 98-100°F max
• Gentle belly massage in circular motions
• Deep breathing exercises
• Warm compress on lower back
• Stay hydrated - dehydration can trigger Braxton Hicks

🚨 **CALL DOCTOR IMMEDIATELY IF:**

**Before 37 Weeks:**
• Regular contractions every 10 minutes or less
• 4 or more contractions in 1 hour
• Contractions getting stronger and closer together
• Lower back pain with contractions
• Pelvic pressure or cramping

**After 37 Weeks:**
• Regular contractions 5 minutes apart for 1 hour
• Water breaks (with or without contractions)
• Severe pain that takes your breath away
• Can't walk or talk through contractions

**Any Time:**
• Vaginal bleeding with tightening
• Severe constant abdominal pain
• Fever with abdominal tightening
• Sudden gush or steady leak of fluid
• Decreased baby movement
