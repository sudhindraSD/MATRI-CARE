# 🎉 HYBRID SYSTEM FIXED - SIMPLE & WORKING!

## ✅ What I Fixed

### The Problem:
- You said "hi" → Should automatically switch to Gemini AI
- Pregnancy questions → Should use database with clear heading
- System wasn't switching properly

### The Solution:
**SIMPLE HYBRID SYSTEM:**

1. **Pregnancy Question?** → 📚 "From Our Curated Database" + medical response
2. **General Question?** → 🤖 Switch to Gemini AI automatically  
3. **No complicated headers** → Clean, natural responses

## 🔧 How It Works Now

### Example 1 - Pregnancy Question:
```
User: "stomach feels tight"
↓
System: Finds match in database
↓ 
Response: "📚 From Our Curated Database

🤰 Tight Stomach Feeling During Pregnancy - Complete Guide:
[Full medical response from Mayo Clinic]"
```

### Example 2 - General Question:
```
User: "hi" 
↓
System: No pregnancy match found
↓
Switches to Gemini AI automatically
↓
Response: "Hello! 👋 I'm MatriCare AI, your pregnancy health assistant! How can I help you today?"
```
